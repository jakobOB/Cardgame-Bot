# Cardgame-Bot

This game is similar to the game "Solitaire". This Bot plays the game 100 times and tells you at the end
how often he has won the game.

**THE RULES:**<br>
You have a Deck of 32 Cards (Bridge Cards from 7 to Ass). You shuffle them at the beginning and create 11 stacks,
10 stacks with three cards and one stack with two cards (with the cards faced up). You also have 4 more stacks.
The goal of the game is to separate the cards by color, sorted by value from low to high (7 at the bottom and the Ass 
at the top). So if you have a seven face up on one of your 11 stacks, you can lay it down on one of the 4 other stacks,
then the 8 (always with the same color) and so on. Inside the 11 stacks you can move the cards around too, but here you
sort them from high to low, so you can move a nine on top of a ten and an eight on top of that nine, but only if they 
have the same number. If there is no more move left, you can shuffle the remaining cards, which you could not move to one 
of the 4 'extra' stacks. In total you can shuffle the cards two times (plus the one at the beginning).
